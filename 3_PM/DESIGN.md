First, we will separate the page into two columns, separated by the div tags. In the column on the right side, we will define and render two separate rows by a list. In the first row, we will have an input text bar and an add button as a line. In the second row, we will have a input search bar. 

In the second column, we will define a component with a constant title at the top and a list of text and buttons that is rendered from an array. The button will be a div with text and a delete by id function. We will render the list last before the user is able to interact with the interface. The add button and delete button re-render the list. 

A layout of our application will look like this:

- todo array
- left column
    - title
    - list 
        - text 
        - button
- right column
    - add bar and button
    - search bar 

More informaton about the "button" component: we will create a render function that creates a list of text and buttons. We will render the string of the to do and id from the state of the component with the help of an array.
